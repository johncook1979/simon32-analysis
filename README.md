# Impact of Differentials in SIMON32 Algorithm for Lightweight Security of Internet of Things
### The code designed for this work will be available once the final paper is published
***
### 📄 Abstract (summary)
We introduce an analysis of differential properties of the SIMON32 cypher, revealing differential characteristics that pave the way for future efficiency enhancements. Our analysis has further increased the number of targeted rounds by identifying high probability differentials within a partial difference distribution table of the SIMON cypher, exceeding existing state-of-the-art benchmarks.


Crypto suite SIMON ISO guidelines are available at [ISO/IEC 29167-21:2018](https://www.iso.org/standard/70388.html) and soon to be replaced by [ISO/IEC FDIS 29167-21](https://www.iso.org/standard/89591.html)
